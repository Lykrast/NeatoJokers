![AneatoHiBWNEW2](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5f1b6ded-700a-432e-b323-a8b4f6ded044) I'm Neato! I'm a pixel artist and part-time streamer.

My pixel art is featured in Balatro! You can find me in the credits of the game. <br>
I am responsible for the **Slay the Spire**, **Binding of Isaac** and **Shovel Knight** friends of Jimbo collabs 

Follow me on [twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/neato)! 
*I stream my pixel art process, Balatro, Rocket League and other roguelikes a couple times a week.*
